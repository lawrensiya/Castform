## *PROJECT TENKI*
***A weather forecasting using data mining, an application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere base on the past and uploaded data.***



## ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT:

*Forecasting is ubiquitous no matter which field you’re In, and in this project, we’re going to focus on making a program that could predict the weather. 
Weather forecasting has been one of the most scientifically and technologically challenging problems all around the world over this century. 
In our proposed project, we are going to use the data mining technique in predicting the weather. 
In the project, we used a data set which contain over 300 weather information that could help us successfully predict the weather.*


## ***FLOW DIAGRAM***

***EXPLANATION OF THE FLOWCHART***

*Firstly, we have a dataset which is then loaded by the program, wherein after loading the dataset it is also cleaned to avoid miscalculations, then we feature the selection and classify it, then this is when we start predicting the weather wherein the final product of the program is the generation of the weather result.*

***EXPLANATION OF THE 2ND FLOWCHART***

*The program consist of a user and an admin where the admin has special privileges in the program.*

## RUNNING THE PROGRAM

***Before we run the program there are some programs and packages that we need to download and they are listed below:***

**Software Requirements**
- Anaconda Navigator
- VS Codes
- PYQT5
- MYSQL
- SQLITE 
- PYQTGraph
